The observed response (404 Not Found, 'Object with id={id} was not found.') is correct for a missing object, but the expected error message is about an invalid type for 'id'. Since the request body incorrectly includes 'id' as JSON and the type validation error is expected, the API should have returned a 400 Bad Request for invalid parameter type, not a 404.

According to the OpenAPI spec and HTTP standards, a PUT request to update an object requires a JSON body and the 'Content-Type: application/json' header to indicate the body format.

The API returns a 400 Bad Request with an error message indicating that the body is missing or incorrect, which matches expected behavior for a missing or invalid body in a PUT request.

According to HTTP standards and REST API best practices, a PUT request with an invalid Content-Type header (such as 'InvalidValue!@#') should be rejected with a 415 status, as the server cannot process the request body in an unsupported format. The OpenAPI spec does not explicitly define custom error messages for invalid Content-Type headers, and the provided error message aligns with standard behavior for this scenario[2][3].

However, the expected error is for a missing required parameter 'id'. According to the OpenAPI spec, the PUT /objects/{id} endpoint requires the 'id' path parameter. If the 'id' is missing from the request, the API should return a 400 Bad Request indicating a missing required parameter, not a 404 for a non-existent object.

Proper request validation should catch the type mismatch and return a 400 Bad Request with a relevant validation error, not a 404. Returning 404 for a type error is inconsistent with standard API validation practices and the provided spec, which expects type validation to occur before resource existence checks[1][2].",0.341

According to the OpenAPI spec and domain knowledge, the POST /objects endpoint requires a JSON body to create a new object. The request sent had a null body and did not include a Content-Type header. The API responded with a 400 Bad Request and an error message indicating the body is missing or incorrect, which matches expected behavior for a missing or invalid request body. The expected error message about a missing optional 'Content-Type' header is not strictly required by HTTP or the spec when the body is absent, and the main issue is the missing body, not the header.
